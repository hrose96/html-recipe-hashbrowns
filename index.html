  <p>Recipe by Angela @ <a href="https://bakeitwithlove.com/"> Bakeitwithlove.com </a> </p>

<h2>Hash Browns</h2>
<!-- 
Ingredients
Russet Potatoes - Red or yellow potatoes are great for this recipe too.
Olive Oil - Or any vegetable oil to fry with.
Seasoning - salt & pepper, fresh or dried chives.
Sharp Cheddar - Optional if you want cheesy hash-browns!
  
Directions 
Peel and grate your fresh, raw, russet potatoes.
Then, place the grated potatoes in a medium-sized mixing bowl filled with cold water let them soak for 15 minutes.
Once all of your potatoes have soaked, squeeze the excess liquid from the grated potatoes and place them onto paper towels. Continue until you have squeezed the water and starch from all of your grated potatoes.
Pat the grated potatoes dry before frying them.
Preheat a large frying pan or skillet with the olive oil to medium-high heat. The oil should begin to shimmer when heated fully.
Portion hash browns into serving size patties (if desired) or place into an oiled, heated frying pan.
Add the salt, pepper, and dried chives for seasoning.
Cover and cook for 5 minutes.
Remove the lid and flip hash browns over. They should be nicely cooked and golden brown.
Top with the optional cheese, if desired, and cook uncovered for approximately 5-7minutes. Your potatoes should be nice and crispy.
Remove from heat, serve and enjoy!-->
